            <h3>What is the LOOP? </h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever worked out in a circle? The LOOP Concept is unique circular workout concept that is based
                on High Interval Training (HIIT). Some of the benefits of HIIT include boosting fat burning and
                post-burn, helping you get in shape faster. That’s is why we can safely say – 24 minutes of fitness,
                that’s enough.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does it work? </h3>
            <p>The training contains a unique combination of exercises performed on 16 fitness machines set up in a
                circle. The 16 machines together provide an effective training of both muscle strength and stamina. At
                the beginning of the workout you select a machine in the circle. Exercise there for 45 seconds until a
                DING sounds and everyone switches to the next machine in the circle. There are 45 seconds between the
                DING sounds. After two rounds in the circle, 24 minutes have gone by and your entire body has been
                trained effectively. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The training </h3>
            <p>The training is done individually, partly by setting the machines to the desired load - and partly by the
                intensity of the exercises. Your results depend on your efforts. Simple as that.

                Although workouts in LOOP takes place in a defined circular exercise program, there is opportunity to
                vary the training to suit your needs by varying the intensity and strain during your workout - a
                well-balanced personal training program, all based on a common plan, which will give you a good training
                experience. </p>
