            Have you ever worked out in a circle? The LOOP Concept is unique circular workout concept that is based on
            High Interval Training (HIIT). Some of the benefits of HIIT include boosting fat burning and post-burn,
            helping you get in shape faster. That’s is why we can safely say – 24 minutes of fitness, that’s enough.

            The training contains a unique combination of exercises performed on 16 fitness machines set up in a circle.
            The 16 machines together provide an effective training of both muscle strength and stamina. At the beginning
            of the workout you select a machine in the circle. Exercise there for 45 seconds until a DING sounds and
            everyone switches to the next machine in the circle. There are 45 seconds between the DING sounds. After two
            rounds in the circle, 24 minutes have gone by and your entire body has been trained effectively.

        <p class="item-paragraph">
            The training is done individually, partly by setting the machines to the desired load - and partly by the
            intensity of the exercises. Your results depend on your efforts. Simple as that.

            Although workouts in LOOP takes place in a defined circular exercise program, there is opportunity to vary
            the training to suit your needs by varying the intensity and strain during your workout - a well-balanced
            personal training program, all based on a common plan, which will give you a good training experience.
